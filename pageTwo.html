            BY NAOMI NEVITT, MAY 9, 2014 .............. <br/> <br/>

    When I had the chance to talk to the seven-time Grammy award winner at her Keds Perfect Pairs event at Nordstrom in Los Angeles yesterday, I decided to find out! I asked a series of rapid-fire questions designed to reveal some cold, hard facts (you know, like what's her spirit animal), all in hopes of giving you a little extra insight into one of the world's biggest stars. <br/>

    Wearing striking blue eyeliner and one of her many signature short sleeve dresses in a matching shade of cobalt, Taylor graciously took the hot seat, and here's what she had to say: <br/> <br/> <br/>

    <br/> <br/><br/> <br/> <br/><br/> <br/> <br/> 
    What's the last book you read? <br/>
    A book about Zelda Fitzgerald. <br/> <br/>
    What's the last website you visited? <br/>
    Anthropologie.com. And real estate websites which I have to stop doing. <br/> <br/>
    What's the last song you listened to? <br/>
    "Cop Car" by Keith Urban. You gotta listen to it. It's my jam. <br/> <br/>
    What's the last song you sang along to? <br/>
    "Sing" by Ed Sheeran. <br/> <br/>
    What's the last movie watched? <br/>
    Runaway Bride. <br/> <br/>

    What's the last TV show you watched? <br/>
    Friends last night—a marathon! <br/> <br/>

    What's the last app used? <br/>
    An astrology one. And it just said, "Be yourself today." And I was like, thanks? It's like when you get a very generic fortune cookie and you're like, "This doesn't help me. I really needed you today and you didn't give me anything real." I think I need to buy the real app. I don't think they give you a lot on the free one. <br/> <br/>

    What's the last museum or monument you visited? <br/>
    The Met because I was at the Met Ball. You walk through the entire museum exhibit to get to the party. I think wearing a ball gown and being with your friends is pretty sick. <br/> <br/>

    What's the last gift you gave a friend? <br/>
    It was random—one of those tiny little emergency kits that have all the things in it a girl would need, like a mini sewing kit. You know, those little glittery bags you can get at Sephora and put in your purse.<br/> <br/>

    What's your spirit animal?<br/>
    A fox. Because they have to run and hide a lot and I have to run and hide a lot too. I didn't mean that to sound sad! In my head it sounded like more of a statement and when I said it, it sounded like something you say before you cry. [Laughs] <br/> <br/>

    If you had one superpower what would it be? <br/>
    Healing people.<br/> <br/>

    What's your motto? <br/>

    "I got 99 problems"—no, I'm just kidding. Did you ever watch the movie Love Actually where Hugh Grant's voiceover says, "If you look around, love actually is all around"? That's my favorite motto. <br/> <br/> <br/>

    As you can see, I left feeling a little bit more enlightened about our favorite Nashville export. And maybe also a teeny bit smug—when her next hit single comes out and talks about fos, I'll know exactly what she means.
